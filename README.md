# MongoDB Data Operator
The MongoDB Data Operator aims to manage the full lifecycle of a mongodb document in you Kubernetes container platforms.

## Overview
The MongoDB Data Operator provides Kubernetes management of MongoDB data store and related mongodb queries.
The purpose of this project is to simplify the mongodb queries for Kubernetes clusters.
A core feature of the MongoDB Data Operator is to create, update, delete mongodb documents

The MongoDB Data operator includes the following features:

* **Kubernetes Custom Resources**: Use Kubernetes custom resources to create, update, delete datas in mongodb collections

## CustomResourceDefinitions
The Operator acts on the following [custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/):

* **`MongoDBConfig`**, which defines a desired MongoDB database connection and collection

* **`MongoDBData`**, which defines a desired MongoDB document

## Getting Started
* Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing,
simply, run `make kind` to have a kind cluster inside your docker.

* or run against a remote cluster.

### Prometheus Installation

You may also need Prometheus installed on your cluster for monitoring,
simply use the below command for prometheus installation on your cluster
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.33/bundle.yaml
```

## Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to MongoDB data operator project!

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster
